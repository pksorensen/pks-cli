# PKS CLI Architecture Documentation

## Overview

PKS CLI is built as a comprehensive agentic development platform using modern .NET patterns and clean architecture principles. The system is designed for extensibility, maintainability, and enterprise-grade reliability.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Clean Architecture
- **Dependency Inversion**: Dependencies flow inward toward the domain
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
- **Testability**: Every component is testable in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Code is organized for easy understanding and modification

### 2. Modular Design
- **Initializer System**: Pluggable project initialization components
- **Service Architecture**: Domain services with clear interfaces
- **Agent Framework**: Extensible agent system for AI coordination
- **Integration Points**: Well-defined interfaces for external systems

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Hooks System**: Event-driven automation and workflows
- **Agent Coordination**: Event-based agent communication
- **Integration Events**: Cross-component event handling

## System Components

### 1. Application Layer
**Location**: `/src/Program.cs`, `/src/Commands/`

The application layer handles user interactions and command processing:

- **Command Pattern**: Each CLI command is a separate class implementing Spectre.Console.Cli patterns
- **Dependency Injection**: Commands receive dependencies through constructor injection
- **Validation**: Input validation and sanitization at the application boundary
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### 2. Infrastructure Layer
**Location**: `/src/Infrastructure/`

The infrastructure layer provides core services and system integration:

#### Services
- **Configuration Service**: Hierarchical configuration management with encryption
- **GitHub Service**: Complete GitHub API integration with secure token management
- **Project Identity Service**: Unique project tracking and cross-component coordination
- **Agent Framework Service**: Multi-agent lifecycle management
- **MCP Server Service**: Model Context Protocol server implementation
- **Hooks Service**: Event-driven automation system
- **PRD Service**: Requirements and documentation management

#### Initializer System
- **Base Classes**: Abstract base classes for template and code-based initializers
- **Registry Pattern**: Dynamic initializer discovery and registration
- **Execution Engine**: Order-based initializer execution with error handling
- **Context Management**: Shared context across initializer execution

### 3. Domain Layer
**Location**: `/src/Infrastructure/Services/Models/`

The domain layer contains core business entities and value objects:

- **Project Identity**: Core project representation with unique identification
- **GitHub Models**: Repository, issue, and workflow representations
- **Agent Models**: Agent configuration and status representations
- **Hook Models**: Hook configuration and execution models
- **MCP Models**: MCP server and tool configuration models

### 4. Integration Layer
**Location**: Various service implementations

Integration with external systems:

- **GitHub API**: RESTful API integration with proper authentication
- **File System**: Cross-platform file operations with proper error handling
- **HTTP Client**: Modern HTTP client patterns for external API calls
- **JSON Serialization**: Consistent JSON handling throughout the system

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Command Pattern
Each CLI command implements the command pattern:
```csharp
public class InitCommand : Command<InitCommand.Settings>
{
    public override int Execute(CommandContext context, Settings settings)
    {
        // Command logic
    }
}
```

### 2. Strategy Pattern
Initializers use the strategy pattern for different initialization approaches:
```csharp
public abstract class BaseInitializer : IInitializer
{
    public abstract Task<InitializationResult> ExecuteAsync(InitializationContext context);
}
```

### 3. Factory Pattern
Service factories for creating configured instances:
```csharp
public class InitializerRegistry : IInitializerRegistry
{
    public IInitializer Create<T>() where T : IInitializer
    {
        return _serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<T>();
    }
}
```

### 4. Observer Pattern
Event-driven architecture for cross-component communication:
```csharp
public interface IHooksService
{
    Task ExecuteHookAsync(string hookName, HookContext context);
}
```

## Data Flow Architecture

### Project Initialization Flow
1. **Command Processing**: `InitCommand` processes user input
2. **Context Creation**: `InitializationService` creates execution context
3. **Initializer Discovery**: `InitializerRegistry` discovers and orders initializers
4. **Sequential Execution**: Initializers execute in dependency order
5. **Project Identity Creation**: `ProjectIdentityService` creates unique project tracking
6. **Integration Setup**: GitHub, MCP, and other integrations are configured
7. **Validation**: All components are validated for proper integration

### Agent Coordination Flow
1. **Agent Registration**: Agents register with the `AgentFrameworkService`
2. **Project Association**: Agents are associated with specific projects
3. **Task Distribution**: Orchestrator distributes tasks to appropriate agents
4. **Execution Monitoring**: Agent execution is monitored and logged
5. **Result Aggregation**: Results are collected and validated
6. **Status Reporting**: Progress and completion status is reported

### MCP Integration Flow
1. **Server Initialization**: Project-specific MCP server is created
2. **Tool Registration**: PKS CLI commands are exposed as MCP tools
3. **Resource Exposure**: Project resources are made available through MCP
4. **Client Connection**: AI assistants connect to the MCP server
5. **Tool Invocation**: AI assistants invoke PKS CLI tools through MCP
6. **Result Processing**: Tool results are returned to AI assistants

## Security Architecture

### 1. Token Management
- **Encryption**: All sensitive tokens are encrypted at rest
- **Scoped Access**: Tokens are scoped to specific projects and operations
- **Secure Storage**: Platform-specific secure storage mechanisms
- **Rotation Support**: Token rotation and expiration handling

### 2. Input Validation
- **Command Validation**: All command inputs are validated
- **Path Traversal Protection**: File path operations are secured
- **Injection Prevention**: SQL and command injection prevention
- **Content Validation**: File content validation before processing

### 3. Secure Defaults
- **Minimal Permissions**: Default to minimal required permissions
- **Secure Configuration**: Secure defaults for all configuration options
- **HTTPS Only**: All external communications use HTTPS
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit logging for security events

## Performance Architecture

### 1. Asynchronous Operations
- **Async/Await**: All I/O operations use async patterns
- **Non-Blocking UI**: Terminal UI remains responsive during operations
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent operations execute in parallel
- **Resource Management**: Proper disposal of resources

### 2. Caching Strategy
- **Configuration Caching**: Frequently accessed configuration is cached
- **HTTP Response Caching**: GitHub API responses are cached appropriately

## Extension Points

### 1. Custom Initializers
Developers can create custom initializers by implementing `IInitializer`:

public class CustomInitializer : CodeInitializer
{
    public override string Id => "custom";
    public override int Order => 100;
    
    protected override async Task ExecuteCodeLogicAsync(
        InitializationContext context, 
        InitializationResult result)
    {
        // Custom initialization logic
    }
}
```

### 2. Custom Agents
Custom agents can be created by implementing agent interfaces:
```csharp
public class CustomAgent : IAgent
{
    public string AgentType => "custom";
    
    public async Task ExecuteAsync(AgentContext context)
    {
        // Custom agent logic
    }
}
```

### 3. Custom Hooks
Custom hooks can be registered with the hooks system:
```csharp
public class CustomHook : IHook
{
    public string HookName => "custom-hook";
    
    public async Task ExecuteAsync(HookContext context)
    {
        // Custom hook logic
    }
}
```
