# Claude Code Hooks Integration Fix

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive fix implemented for Claude Code hooks integration issues in PKS CLI.

## Issues Resolved

### Issue #15: Fix hooks command output for Claude Code compatibility
- **Problem**: Hook commands were outputting banners, ASCII art, and UI elements that interfered with JSON output expected by Claude Code
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `HookDecision` class for type-safe JSON responses
  - Added `--json` flag support for JSON-only output mode
  - Implemented `BaseHookCommand` with proper output handling
  - Modified `Program.cs` to suppress banners for hook events
  - Silent operation for "proceed" decisions (no output)

### Issue #14: pks hooks init generates wrong hook names
- **Problem**: Generated hooks used camelCase naming instead of PascalCase expected by Claude Code
- **Solution**:
  - Added `HookNames` constants class with PascalCase names
  - Implemented automatic migration from legacy camelCase to PascalCase
  - Added validation and error handling for hook names
  - Updated all hook generation to use correct naming

### Issue #13: pks hooks init is not generating a precompact hook
- **Problem**: PreCompact hook was missing from initialization
- **Solution**:
  - Created `PreCompactCommand.cs` with proper implementation
  - Added to hook configuration generation
  - Registered in `Program.cs` command structure

### Issue #12: pks hooks init is not generating a subagent stop hook
- **Problem**: SubagentStop hook was missing from initialization
- **Solution**:
  - Created `SubagentStopCommand.cs` with proper implementation
  - Added to hook configuration generation
  - Registered in `Program.cs` command structure

### Issue #11: pks hooks init should create a notification hook also
- **Problem**: Notification hook was missing from initialization
- **Solution**:
  - Created `NotificationCommand.cs` with proper implementation
  - Added to hook configuration generation
  - Registered in `Program.cs` command structure

## Technical Implementation

### New Classes Created
- `HookDecision` - Type-safe JSON response model
- `BaseHookCommand` - Shared functionality for all hook commands
- `NotificationCommand` - Handles notification events
- `SubagentStopCommand` - Handles subagent stop events
- `PreCompactCommand` - Handles pre-compact events

### Files Modified
- `HooksService.cs` - Enhanced with PascalCase naming and migration logic
- `HooksCommand.cs` - Added JSON flag support
- `Program.cs` - Enhanced banner suppression for hook events
- All existing hook commands - Refactored to use `BaseHookCommand`
- `HookModels.cs` - Added `HookDecision` and validation models

### Test Coverage
- Created comprehensive test suite with 96 tests
- Tests cover all hook types, output formats, and error scenarios
- Integration tests for Claude Code compatibility
- Validation tests for naming conventions

## Claude Code Compatibility

The updated hooks system now fully complies with Claude Code requirements:

✅ **Silent Operation**: No output for proceed decisions
✅ **JSON Format**: Proper camelCase JSON with null omission
✅ **PascalCase Naming**: All hook names use correct format
✅ **Complete Coverage**: All 7 hook types supported
✅ **Banner Control**: No banners for hook events

## Usage Examples

### JSON Mode (Claude Code)
```bash
pks hooks pre-tool-use --json    # No output (proceed)
pks hooks post-tool-use --json   # No output (proceed)
```

### User-Friendly Mode
```bash
pks hooks pre-tool-use          # Shows environment and status
pks hooks init                  # Shows banner and progress
```

### Generated Hook Configuration
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{"type": "command", "command": "pks hooks pre-tool-use"}],
    "PostToolUse": [{"type": "command", "command": "pks hooks post-tool-use"}],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{"type": "command", "command": "pks hooks user-prompt-submit"}],
    "Notification": [{"type": "command", "command": "pks hooks notification"}],
    "Stop": [{"type": "command", "command": "pks hooks stop"}],
    "SubagentStop": [{"type": "command", "command": "pks hooks subagent-stop"}],
    "PreCompact": [{"type": "command", "command": "pks hooks pre-compact"}]
  }
}
```

## Migration Support

The implementation includes automatic migration from legacy camelCase configurations:
- Detects old naming conventions
- Migrates to PascalCase automatically
- Preserves existing custom hooks
- Provides clear migration messaging

## Testing

All changes are covered by comprehensive tests:
- Unit tests for hook commands and services
- Integration tests for Claude Code compatibility
- Error handling tests for graceful degradation
- Validation tests for naming conventions

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility:
- Legacy camelCase hooks are automatically migrated
- Non-JSON mode preserves user-friendly output
- Existing functionality remains unchanged
- Clear migration guidance provided
