## GitHub Issue #4 Details

**Title:** Warning for first time usage

**Status:** Open

**Author:** pksorensen (Owner)

**Created:** 2025-07-20T12:14:51Z

**Description:**
I want a warning first time a user uses the cli that should be short and consice that tells the user that this CLI is made by AI and the generated code have not been validated by any humans. AI may make mistakes and we advice people to run at their own risk. People are welcome to look at the code and report issues on github.

## Analysis Summary
This is a request to implement a first-time user warning system that:
1. Shows a disclaimer about AI-generated code
2. Warns about potential risks
3. Encourages code review and issue reporting
4. Should be short and concise
5. Only shows on first usage

## Initial Understanding
This feature requires:
- A mechanism to detect first-time usage
- A warning message display system
- User acknowledgment/acceptance
- Storage of user preference to not show again
