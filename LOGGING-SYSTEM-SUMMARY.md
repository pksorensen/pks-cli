# PKS CLI Comprehensive Logging System

## Overview

I have successfully built a comprehensive logging system for PKS CLI that captures command execution telemetry, tracks user interactions, stores session data for reporting, and integrates seamlessly with existing services using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging patterns.

## System Architecture

The logging system consists of four main components:

### 1. Command Telemetry Service (`ICommandTelemetryService`)
- **Purpose**: Tracks command execution metrics, performance data, and feature usage
- **Key Features**:
  - Command execution tracking with correlation IDs
  - Performance metrics (execution time, memory usage, CPU usage)
  - Feature usage analytics
  - Error type classification and statistics
  - Configurable data retention with automatic cleanup

### 2. User Interaction Service (`IUserInteractionService`)
- **Purpose**: Monitors user behavior patterns and interaction analytics
- **Key Features**:
  - User input tracking with response times
  - Navigation pattern analysis
  - Preference change monitoring
  - Error interaction tracking
  - Help usage analytics
  - User workflow identification

### 3. Session Data Service (`ISessionDataService`)
- **Purpose**: Manages user sessions and persistent data storage
- **Key Features**:
  - Session lifecycle management
  - Client environment tracking
  - Session data persistence
  - Comprehensive reporting capabilities
  - Automatic session cleanup
  - Data export in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, XML)

### 4. Logging Orchestrator (`ILoggingOrchestrator`)
- **Purpose**: Coordinates all logging activities and provides unified interface
- **Key Features**:
  - Command execution context management
  - Cross-service data correlation
  - Comprehensive statistics aggregation
  - Usage report generation
  - Data cleanup orchestration

```

### Base Classes for Easy Integration

```
/workspace/pks-cli/src/Infrastructure/Commands/
└── LoggingCommandBase.cs                # Base class for commands with logging
```

### Registration and Configuration

The logging system is registered in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
// Register comprehensive logging system
services.AddSingleton<ICommandTelemetryService, CommandTelemetryService>();
services.AddSingleton<IUserInteractionService, UserInteractionService>();
services.AddSingleton<ISessionDataService, SessionDataService>();
services.AddSingleton<ILoggingOrchestrator, LoggingOrchestrator>();
services.AddSingleton<ICommandLoggingWrapper, CommandLoggingWrapper>();
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Using LoggingCommandBase for New Commands

```csharp
public class MyCommand : LoggingCommandBase<MyCommandSettings>
{
    public MyCommand(ILogger<MyCommand> logger, ILoggingOrchestrator loggingOrchestrator)
        : base(logger, loggingOrchestrator) { }

    protected override async Task<int> ExecuteCommandAsync(CommandContext context, MyCommandSettings settings)
    {
        // Log feature usage
        await LogFeatureUsageAsync("my_feature", new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            ["setting_value"] = settings.Value,
            ["enabled"] = true
        });

        // Log user interaction with automatic timing
        var userInput = await LoggedPromptAsync(
            () => AnsiConsole.Ask<string>("Enter value:"),
            "Enter a value",
            "user_input"
        );

        // Track performance-intensive operations
        var result = await WithStatusAsync(async () =>
        {
            // Perform work
            await Task.Delay(1000);
            return "Success";
        }, "Processing data", "data_processing");

        return 0;
    }
}
```

### 2. Direct Orchestrator Usage

```csharp
// Initialize command logging
var context = await loggingOrchestrator.InitializeCommandLoggingAsync("my-command", args, userId);

// Log various activities
await loggingOrchestrator.LogFeatureUsageAsync(context, "feature_name", featureData);
await loggingOrchestrator.LogUserInteractionAsync(context, "prompt", "Question", "Answer", 1500);
await loggingOrchestrator.LogErrorAsync(context, exception, "retry", true);

// Finalize
await loggingOrchestrator.FinalizeCommandLoggingAsync(context, success, error, summary);
```
